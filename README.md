Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) ML Model
This repository contains a Python machine learning model built using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. The model aims to classify breast cancer diagnoses as either malignant or benign based on various features extracted from diagnostic images.

Dataset
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset is publicly available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It consists of 569 instances with 30 numeric features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast mass. Each instance is labeled as either malignant (M) or benign (B).

You can find the dataset here.

Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required to run the ML model:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
You can install them using pip:

Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
Usage
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/breast-cancer-wisconsin-ml-model.git
cd breast-cancer-wisconsin-ml-model
Run the Jupyter Notebook breast_cancer_wisconsin_model.ipynb to train and evaluate the machine learning model.

Feel free to modify and experiment with the model, hyperparameters, or techniques to suit your needs.

Results
The ML model achieves an accuracy of [insert accuracy score] on the test set. You can find a detailed classification report in the notebook that includes precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
